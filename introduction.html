	<h2>Introduction to Pangool: Topical Word Count (1/3)</h2>
	</p>
	<p>This introduction guides you into the basics of Pangool through a Word-Count-like example.<p>
	<p>Through this introduction you'll quickly see what is Pangool about and how will Pangool make your life easier.</p>
	<p>First of all, you'll quickly see how to use <strong>Tuples</strong>, <strong>Schemas</strong> and build a simple <strong>Tuple MapReduce Job</strong> that <strong>groups by</strong> some fields.</p>
</div>

<h2>Topical Word Count</h2>

<p>
We’re sure you’ve seen several times the "typical word count". 
We have extended the problem for showing the advantages of using Pangool. <i>We like extending things - Pangool is an implementation of an "extended model of MapReduce" <a href='http://www.datasalt.com/2012/02/tuple-mapreduce-beyond-the-classic-mapreduce/'>we like to call Tuple MapReduce.</a></i>
</p>

<p>
This example is the "topical word count". (Crowd applauds!).
</p>

<p> 
In the input we will have one JSON record per line, containing the fields "text" and "topic". 
Topic is an integer that labels the textual content as belonging to a certain topic. 
This example record has a text "foo bar2" labelled as topic = 1.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	{ text: "foo bar", topic: 1 }
</pre>

<p>
We want to count the appearances of each word within a topic. That is, if we have this input:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	{ text: "foo bar", topic: 1 }
	{ text: "foo", topic: 1 }
	{ text: "bar bar", topic: 2 }
	{ text: "foo", topic: 2 }
</pre>

<p>
And considering an output schema like (topic, word, count), we want to have as output: 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	(1, "foo", 2)
	(1, "bar", 1)
	(2, "bar", 2)
	(2, "foo", 1)
</pre>

<p>
You can check the full code of this example on github <a href='https://github.com/datasalt/pangool/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/com/datasalt/pangool/examples/topicalwordcount/TopicalWordCount.java'>by clicking here</a>.
</p>

<p>
We’ll start by writing a Mapper. For Pangool Jobs, we need to extend <a href='https://github.com/datasalt/pangool/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/datasalt/pangool/tuplemr/TupleMapper.java'>TupleMapper</a>. 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
public static class TokenizeMapper extends TupleMapper<LongWritable, Text> {

	protected Tuple tuple;
	protected ObjectMapper mapper; // This is Jackson's JSON Parser that we'll use for parsing the input

	public void setup(TupleMRContext context, Collector collector) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
		this.mapper = new ObjectMapper();
		tuple = new Tuple(context.getTupleMRConfig().getIntermediateSchema(0));
	};

	public void map(LongWritable key, Text value, TupleMRContext context, Collector collector) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
		Map document = mapper.readValue(value.toString(), Map.class); // Parse JSON
		tuple.set("topic", (Integer) document.get("topicId"));
		StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer((String) document.get("text"));
		tuple.set("count", 1);
		while(itr.hasMoreTokens()) {
			tuple.set("word", itr.nextToken());
			emitTuple(collector); // We are creating a method for this to allow overriding it from subclasses
		}
	}

	protected void emitTuple(Collector collector) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
		collector.write(tuple);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
TupleMappers have the usual methods available: setup(), map() and cleanup(). 
The main difference is that we will always emit Tuples when working with them. 
We see how it is possible to cache a Tuple for avoiding excessive object creation:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	tuple = new Tuple(context.getTupleMRConfig().getIntermediateSchema(0));
</pre>

<p>
Tuples need to be created with an <a href='https://github.com/datasalt/pangool/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/datasalt/pangool/io/Schema.java'>Schema</a>. We can grab the Schema we define by index or by name. 
(We’ll show how to define this Schema later). 
</p>

<p>
When working with tuples, we can set fields using the name of the field defined in the Schema:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	tuple.set("word", itr.nextToken());
</pre>

<p>
Finally, we see how we use the Pangool collector for emitting Tuples:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	collector.write(tuple);
</pre>

<p>
(Apart from the Pangool Collector, we also have the TupleMRContext. This class wraps the information that we setup in the Tuple MapReduce Job + the standard Hadoop Context. You can use it to access the Hadoop Counters, for instance. 
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
For more information, check the <a href='userguide/TupleMrBuilder.html'>"Creating Pangool Jobs"</a> user guide page.
</div>

<p>
Now, we need to write a Reducer. The Reducer will extend <a href='https://github.com/datasalt/pangool/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/datasalt/pangool/tuplemr/TupleReducer.java'>TupleReducer</a>. (Again, this Reducer only has two types. It always receives ITuple, NullWritable from the Mapper, so we need to specify the two types of the output. In this case we’ll also output ITuple, NullWritable)
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
public static class CountReducer extends TupleReducer<ITuple, NullWritable> {

	public void reduce(ITuple group, Iterable<ITuple> tuples, TupleMRContext context, Collector collector) throws IOException, InterruptedException, TupleMRException {

		int count = 0;
		ITuple outputTuple = null;
		for(ITuple tuple : tuples) {
			count += (Integer) tuple.get("count");
			outputTuple = tuple;
		}
		outputTuple.set("count", count);
		collector.write(outputTuple, NullWritable.get());
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
The reducer counts and emits a Tuple with the total count. (Note how we reuse a Tuple instance from the Iterator in order to avoid object creation and boilerplate code).
</p>

<p>
And now for the most important part of it. Let’s create a Tuple MapReduce!
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
TupleMRBuilder mr = new TupleMRBuilder(conf, "Pangool Topical Word Count");
mr.addIntermediateSchema(getSchema());
// We will count each (topicId, word) pair
// Note that the order in which we defined the fields of the Schema is not relevant here
mr.setGroupByFields("topic", "word");
mr.addInput(new Path(args[0]), new HadoopInputFormat(TextInputFormat.class), new TokenizeMapper());
// We'll use a TupleOutputFormat with the same schema than the intermediate schema
mr.setTupleOutput(new Path(args[1]), getSchema());
mr.setTupleReducer(new CountReducer());
mr.setTupleCombiner(new CountReducer());
</pre>

<p>
There are several things to note here:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	cg.addIntermediateSchema(getSchema());
</pre>

<ul>
	<li>When using Tuple MapReduce, we need to define intermediate schemas. 
	These are the Schemas that Pangool will use for serializing the tntermediate output. 
	In this case our schema is formed by "word" (Utf8), "topic" (Int) and "count" (Int).
	Tuples that we emit in the Mapper need to conform to this Schema.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	List<Field> fields = new ArrayList<Field>();
	// The schema has 3 fields: word, topicId and count
	fields.add(Field.create("word", Type.STRING));
	fields.add(Field.create("topic", Type.INT));
	fields.add(Field.create("count", Type.INT));
	return new Schema("schema", fields);
</pre>

<ul>
	<li>Note that the order in which we define the fields is not important.</li> 
</ul>
	
<div class="alert alert-info">
For more information, you can go to the <a href='userguide/schemas.html'>"Tuples & Schemas & Types"</a> user guide page.
</div>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	cg.setGroupByFields("topic", "word");
</pre>

<p>
This is one of the key Pangool’s feature. 
With this setting, we are saying that we want to group by these two fields 
(that need to be present in the intermediate schema). 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	cg.addInput(new Path(args[0]), new HadoopInputFormat(TextInputFormat.class), new TokenizeMapper());
</pre>

<p>
Note how Mappers and InputFormats are instances. This will allow you to manage trivial state information easily. You’ll see this deeply in the next step.
</p> 

<p>
And that’s about it! Note how we’ve created a MapReduce Job that works with 3 fields, 
grouping by two of them and how painlessly it has been! - <i>And by the way, <a href='benchmark.html'>it will perform very efficiently!</a></i>
</p>

<p>
You can run this example by doing:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	hadoop jar $PANGOOL_EXAMPLES_JAR topical_word_count [input] [output]
</pre>

<p>
You can also use an input data generator for generating random input for this example:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
	hadoop jar $PANGOOL_EXAMPLES_JAR topical_word_count_gen_data [out-file] [nRegisters] [nTopics]
</pre>
