<h2>Downloading Pangool source code</h2>

<div class="alert">
Pangool is in the process of being uploaded to a Maven repository. Meanwhile, you can download a release or build from sources. You can download Pangool from the 
<a href="https://github.com/datasalt/pangool/downloads">download page</a>
or you can clone the latest version from <a href="https://github.com/datasalt">Github</a>. For more info go to the <a href='build.html'>"Building Pangool" page</a>
</div>

<p>
You can download Pangool from the

</p>

<h2>Executing an example</h2>

<p>
In the Pangool release there is a Hadoop-executable JAR with Pangool examples. We'll show how to use it to execute the "Moving average" example.
</p>
<p>
The "Moving average" example calculates the moving average of unique visitors for different URLs for each date in a specific timeframe.
</p>
<p>
In the input file we'll have something like:
</p>
<pre>
url1	2011-10-28	10
url1	2011-10-29	20
url1	2011-10-30	30
url1	2011-10-31	40
</pre>
<p>
For moving averages of 3 days we'll have as output: 
</p>
<pre>
url1	2011-10-28	10.0
url1	2011-10-29	15.0
url1	2011-10-30	20.0
url1	2011-10-31	30.0
</pre>
 
<h2>Executing it in Hadoop's pseudo-distributed mode</h2>

<p>
For each Pangool example there as an associated random input data generator. We can execute the Moving average input data generator like:
</p>
<pre>
hadoop jar pangool-examples-*.jar moving_average_gen_data url_regs.txt 10000 200
</pre>
<p>
(If you missed the parameters, an meaningful help line will appear to guide you)
</p>
<p>
Now you can execute the example against the fresh "url_regs.txt" file:
</p>
<pre>
hadoop jar pangool-examples-*.jar moving_average url_regs.txt out-moving-average 5
</pre>
<p>
After this has finished, you'd have generated 5-day moving averages for your input data file.
<p>

<h2>Executing it from an IDE</h2>

<p>
If you are working from an IDE such as Eclipse, you can execute the following code in a new class of your choice:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" id="java">
 	ToolRunner.run(new MovingAverageGenData(), new String[] { "url_regs.txt", "10000", "200" });
 	ToolRunner.run(new MovingAverage(), new String[] { "url_regs.txt", "out-moving-average", "5" });
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i>
Should you encounter any problem, please make sure that both Pangool and Pangool-examples JARs are in the classpath.
